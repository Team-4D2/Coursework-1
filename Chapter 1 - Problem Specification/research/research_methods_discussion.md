## Requirements gathering

We interviewed 6 people who are part of a wide range of societies for 5-15 minutes each (45 minutes was the maximum time we would allow an interview to take), recording the interviewee as it happened. This was to make sure we could ask any follow up questions if the need arouse and clarify any of the questions. The questions asked were:


    "How many socs are you a part of?" This was to see how many Societies the application would need to handle for the average users
    "How many different apps do you have for society news?" This was to see how many competitors we would have in the market
    "would you be interested in something to put all of these in one place?" Too see if there was a market for consolidating society news
    "When you are missing information, how do you get in touch with your societies?" Too see what features would be needed for getting in contact with committee members
    "How long does it take for them to get back to you?" Too see what the average response time would need to be
    "Do you find you miss events due to messages getting lost?" Too see how we would need to structure the app in terms of notifications
    "What type of posts do the societies make on social media?" Too see what type of media would the app need to support
    "What is your favourite social media app that you use for societies and why?" This was to see what to competition was and why users used them
    "How many social media apps do you use, and of these which do you use the most and why?" Too see what we would need to do in order to keep users on the app
    "How many societies were you interested in, and how many have you actually gone to? + why did you miss their events?"
    "What's your best way to interact with a society's event?" To see how users interact with posts
    "Do you prefer seeing the details first, chatting to someone before deciding or being able to reserve a spot through an app?" Too see how what makes users go to events 
    "If you were to share an event with friends, what would be the easiest way for you to do that?" In order too see how users spread information about events
    "If you’re deciding whether to attend an event, does viewing a guest list help?" Too see if we need to track user attendance



The interviews were then transcribed and analysed for patterns. The average answer was taken to identify patterns. some unique answers were also highlighted

Everyone was in favour of the app With some concerns about notifications being overwhelming. WhatsApp and Instagram was the most commonly used apps for society news, with people being apart of 2 society's on average (4.7 for mean, 2 for median, 2 for mode), the average response time of committee members was the same day (5/6 days mean, 0 days median 0 days mode) if the responses of some variant of the word quickly is counted as in a day. TikTok and Instagram was the most well liked social media apps used, this tells of a preference for scrolling like apps and not chat based or page based ones (WhatsApp, Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter \[X] for example) liking posts seems to be the preferred way of people to interact with the post societies make. The posts in question also are mainly test and image based with no audio or video posts being made, posters where also commonly mentioned by the interviewees but this can be combined with images for general media type. people liked to talk to people directly in order to inform them about events, seconded to this was sharing the post in the apps. A guest list was not important for people when deciding weather to go an event. People didn't attended events only because of scheduling problems and very rarely because of missing posts.

Unfortunately not many people interviewed were members of a committee so the data gathered was very sparse, the questions asked to committee members in addition to the original questions was:


    "How do distribute news to your members?" primer for the next question
    "Why do you use this method?" in order to see why a society will use a certain method over others
    "How would you say members engage with your announcements?" see how societies measure engagement of posts
    "What is the biggest hurdle to engage with your society?" to get any problems with engagement societies might be facing
    "What forms of media do you distribute and why?" EG, text , images, video, polls. To see why certain media is used for posts
    "Have you set up a shared calendar?" If not would you believe a shared synced calendar would be useful? to see if a shared calendar is wanted
    "Do you send out communication over more than one channel already?" see how news is organised by societies
    "Do you manage your society on multiple social media accounts, if so how difficult is it to do so?" to see if there is any problems with multiple channels of distribution
    "When managing queries related to the society, how long do you typically take to reply?" to see if there are any problems with the current method being used
    "When posting about events, what information do you typically include?" see what and why information is posted
    "What is your typical event turnout, and how do you think it might be improved?" to see what features societies might want for improving event engagement

Due to the share lack of data, proper analysis would be made difficult and would just be repeating what was said in the interviews
