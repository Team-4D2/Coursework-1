## interview 4

Q: How many societies are you apart of?

A: I'm in two

Q: So how many apps do you have for society news?

A: well like witch ones do I use? I don't have them for societies, but I do use Insta and WhatsApp

Q: So do you receive any sort of society related information from these apps?

A: yeah

Q: So would you be interested in an app for all society information

A: defiantly

Q: So when your missing any information about your society how do you get in touch with them?

A: Well there's just a group chat, I don't think there's anything for beer pong, I haven't attended anything for that one, but yeah there's just a WhatsApp group chat you just message in, and there's every one in it so

Q: So how long does it take for them to get back to you

A: I think it depends but like really quickly, because like even if they don't respond someone else will

Q: So do you ever miss events because you lose track of messages

A: yeah, I think I've actually never attended any of them other than clubbing soz but I do find that like other than one post on Instagram and one post on WhatsApp like suddenly like what time is it tonight and I'm like is it tonight I didn't know that

Q: so what type of posts is it that they make, do you follow there Instagram, so what type of posts

A: So it's actually like well done like they put where it is and the time and stuff but like they release it like, so they release it the first day of every month, so like the stuff at the end I have no idea what's on anymore

Q: is that because they don't post about the stuff

A: No

Q: and so what's your favourite social media app overall, no that you use for societies?

A: for societies probably Instagram because I like seeing the posts 

Q: Ok, so how many social media apps do you use overall?

A: probably too many, like not society related?

Q: yeah just overall, if you had to name them all

A:  well I use Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, snapchat, twitter, discord, does YouTube count? because some say it does some say it doesn't, is that all of them like 6, 7 that was unintentional sorry guys

Q: I think YouTube does count because they've got the community feature and comments

A: yeah

Q: but if you only use it for watching videos, yeah ok which one do you use the most?

A: TikTok

Q: why?

A: it's just like I don't know it's nice to just like not watch anything of meaning, because sometimes it's like a show or movie is just too much and like you wanna like doom scroll and not take any of it in

Q: A lot of people have said TikTok and like why and I'm like ok I think I know why. How many societies where you interested in at the beginning and how many now have you actually gone to

A: I was interested in quite a few actually but I honestly didn't really know how to join them like if anyone else I knew was joining them so I only joined thew kpop one because I knew someone in it I didn't join any like on a whim but I did really wanna join model un, didn't though really sad

Q: does it actually work and does it go on

A: neither, I just saw it at the fair and it looked really nice and my sister  does it so I was like kinda want to

Q: fair enough, bec ause I was searching up model UN because it's quite cool

A: do they not do it? maybe it wasn't model UN, but it was something like model UN

Q: SO was it just that you didn't go to them because you didn't know how to get...

A: yeah like with the kpop one it was quite easy because someone was already in it so she could tell me how to join  and like how to get into the group chats and stuff but like the others like I don't really know how to start and like I'm not that interested to like go through that much effort

Q: and what's the best way for you to interact with events like a society's post about an event

A: best way to interact, like if I had a question or something?

Q: yeah or like if you saw like an Instagram post would you sort of like it?

A: yeah I like all of there stuff, to be fair I am friends with the organizers

Q: are you a committee member at all?

A: no

Q: and yeah, if you had to show the event to a friend, how would you do that, like a society's event

A: I'd just tell them very word of mouth or maybe share the post probably

Q: and would it help to see a guest list for an event if you wanted to attend it?

A: probably, because sometimes I'm like because they've got one on Wednesday and I probably won't go if , if my friends aren't going
