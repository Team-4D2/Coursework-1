## Requirements Gathering Methods

To develop requirements, we utilised a semi-structured interview, with an additional set of questions designed for society committee members – collecting qualitative primary data. This allowed us to gain a comprehensive understanding of our participants’ experience as both members of a society, and members of their committees. 
 
We made use of an opportunity sampling method – and for the majority of our interviews we attempted to keep our sample representative by limiting our sample frame to people sitting down in the following buildings: Eldon, Park, University Library 

We interviewed 9 members who were members of a wide range of societies, on average for 10 minutes each, recording each one as it happened. The interviews were then transcribed for us to analyse, allowing us to see patterns to inform our requirements. 
 
#### Question Sets 
 
1. How many societies are you a part of? 
2. How many different apps do you have for society news? 
- Would you be interested in something to put all of these in one place? 
3. When you are missing information, how do you get in touch with your societies? 
- How long does it take for them to get back to you? 
4. Do you find you miss events due to messages getting lost? 
5. What type of posts do the societies make on social media? 
6. What is your favourite social media app that you use for societies and why? 
7. How many social media apps do you use, and of these which do you use the most and why? 
8. How many societies where you interested in, and how many have you actually gone to? 
- Why did you miss their events? 
9. What's your best way to interact with a society's event? 
10. Do you prefer seeing the details first, chatting to someone before deciding or being able to reserve a spot through an app? 
11. If you were to share an event with friends, what would be the easiest way for you to do that? 
12. If you’re deciding whether to attend an event, does viewing a guest list help? 

1. How do distribute news to your members? 
- Why do you use this method 
2. How would you say members engage with your announcements? 
3. What is the biggest hurdle to engage with your society? 
4. What forms of media (E.g. text, images, video, polls) do you distribute and why?  
5. Have you set up a shared calendar? If not, do you believe this could be useful? 
6. Do you send out communication over more than one channel already? 
7. Do you manage your society on multiple social media accounts, if so, how difficult is this 
8. When managing queries related to the society, how long do you typically take to reply 
9. When posting about events, what information do you typically include? 
10. What is your typical event turnout, and how do you think it might be improved? 

### Reflections on Methodology 

Largely we believe our methodology to have been successful, through the nature of our semi structured interview format, we avoided many of the pitfalls of structured and unstructured interviews. The use of an opportunity sample may have been problematic, as it would have given rise to investigator effects and so our data may not be as representative as we hope, potentially lacking external validity. 
 
On the other hand, our research may also lack internal validity, with our 3rd question perhaps being too leading – giving way to demand characteristics; a majority of our participants replied positively. 
 
Whilst most of the individual questions were suitable for prompting participants, question 11 proved to be less useful, as finding out the details was a must for all participants – and so we would change this if we did this again. 
 
Our 9th question was also too vague, requiring us to add clarification which should have been there to begin with. 

### Reflections on Results 

As mentioned above, most participants were positive about the potential application. 
 
The insights regarding the numbers of societies people were a part of (average x), and how many they intended to join from the start of the year (average y) indicated the troubles societies have with member retention – with this being partially demonstrated by interviews with committee members. 
 
There were however some concerns about notifications being overwhelming. This is consistent with the notification heavy nature of WhatsApp and Instagram – which were noted as being the apps people use most for societies.  
 
The information we received about people’s favourite apps (TikTok and Instagram) ultimately reinforced our understanding of the prevalence of doomscrollinginsert reference, which we will be taking on board as we progress to the design of our user interface. Equally, the generally speedy response time for members contacting societies will need to be something we enable with our UI.  
 
The most common way people interact with posts is likes (or affirming reactions), across Instagram Posts, Stories and WhatsApp messages – with the posts mainly being text/image based. 
 
Calendar posters also seem to be a common way societies outreach to members – supporting our core calendar feature. These also require images to be posted – which alongside text were the most common post type. Polls and videos were also common, and so a seamless integration for these will be important. 
 

Few expressed support for a guest list, and so we’ll ensure our UI does not prioritise this feature.
