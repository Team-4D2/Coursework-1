Looking at these interviews, here are the key common themes:

## Communication Channels
- **Everyone uses WhatsApp and Instagram** as their primary platforms for society communications
- Email is rarely or never used by members
- Most people juggle between 2-4 different apps for society information

## Response Times
- Society committees typically respond **within a day** (ranging from instantly to 2 days)
- Quick responses are common, especially when multiple committee members are available

## Missing Events
- People generally **don't miss events due to not seeing messages** - they miss them due to scheduling conflicts or lack of interest
- However, one person mentioned losing track of events when information is released too far in advance

## Social Media Preferences
- **TikTok is the most-used app overall** for most interviewees (for mindless scrolling/doom scrolling)
- Instagram is preferred for society-related content specifically
- People engage by liking posts or replying in WhatsApp, but don't heavily interact on Instagram

## Content Types
- Societies post **images/posters with event details** (time, place, what's happening)
- Both stories and permanent posts are used

## Interest in a Unified App
- **Everyone expressed interest** in an app that consolidates society communications
- Key caveat: concerns about notification overload; want ability to mute certain societies and customize preferences

## Guest Lists
- Seeing who's attending an event **doesn't really influence decisions** for most people
- People prefer asking friends directly if they're going
