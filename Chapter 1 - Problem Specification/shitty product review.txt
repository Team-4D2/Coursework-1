WhatsApp is primarily chat focused, excelling at communication with society members, but falls short with society messaging, missing features like polls, the standard infinite scrolling window for all messages also makes it hard to search older posts from certain people or the society itself. WhatsApp also supports sending media along with messages like images and video. users of WhatsApp can also reply to messages with emojis, allowing for a simple form of likes in a crude way, the overwhelming amount of options available however, can cause some confusion as to what the emoji means. The lack of chat management can cause some problems in finding society chats vs chats with other people, adding unnecessary friction for users.
