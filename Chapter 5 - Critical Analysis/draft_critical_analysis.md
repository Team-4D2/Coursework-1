 # Critical Analysis

 This semester we have successfully identified a key gap in the university experience for students - one which we believe our application can fill.

 Through defining our methodology for gathering requirements, developing user requirements from these and then translating these into system requirements we were able to acutely identify the problem we aimed to solve.

 We then developed an architectural model, to support our eventual implementation.
 We accompanied these with (n) key use cases.

 To prepare for implementation we then investigated the tools we could make use of, and the ways we would test our design.

 Completing this was not a straightforward task as we encountered complications which challenged our teamwork skills - offering us opportunity to learn and achieve.

 ## Progress Monitoring

 We initially we began with 7 team members, and using a simple table in a word document to track attendance.

 As the first few weeks went by as we brainstormed draft ideas for our app, and expored how we designed our questions, we realised there was an
