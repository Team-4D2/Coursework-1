We will be running the backend using Python with the Flask framework alongside JWT and Flask-SQLAlchemy. Flask allows us to quickly and easily set up multiple web endpoints. JWT will provide access control for the Flutter mobile app; specifically, the authorization tokens will be created on the Flutter app and sent in the URL request to Flask.

After the endpoint has verified that the JWT is valid, it can make a request to the SQL database using SQLAlchemy, extract the relevant data, and return it via a REST API. The entire server will be run within a Docker container so it can be easily deployed onto a VM or VPS. The frontend will be developed entirely in Flutter, utilizing persistent storage to keep the user logged in using the shared storage system. When the app opens, a JWT will be created for the session, allowing the app to download the list of users' societies and check for new notifications.

We also explored alternatives for this stack. We considered using Firebase, which would remove the need for a dedicated server and SQL database by utilizing Google's serverless backend and built-in authentication. We also looked at React Native as a frontend alternative due to its ease of use and extensive set of libraries to help optimize development; however, the major advantage of Flutter is that all our members already know Dart.
