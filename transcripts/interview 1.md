## interview 1

Q: so how many societies are you apart of?

A: augh, 2 but I only ever go to one because I don't have time to go to the politics societies on Tuesdays so

Q: how many different apps do you have for society news?

A: I didn't know there was an app for society news

Q: no, no as in like Instagram 

A:  oh no usually I have Instagram, I use WhatsApp quite a bit for information and general chat and stuff

Q: and do you guys use Email at all

A: no

Q: so it's just WhatsApp and Instagram?

A: yeah

Q: would you be intrusted in an app for consolidating that into one place?

A: umm, that would be convenient, it's, WhatsApp's been quite good for just general chat, so unless you part of multiple societies because I heard WhatsApp can be quite cluttered in terms of I've got multiple messages and I can't find the chat for Christian union or what ever and in terms of Instagram, I follow multiple people so I may not see there posts, so it might be a benefit to have that all centralised

Q: what reasons do you think you wouldn't what it to be centralised like that?

A: I think, social media that every one has, and that downloading  another app might be a thing and not seeing it and not using it but with WhatsApp and Instagram you use it all the time so your more likely to see that and get notifications and at the same time when you want to message a committee member privately you can just find them in the WhatsApp group chat with out trying to do whatever

Q: so when you're missing information like about your society, how do you get in touch with them, like through WhatsApp?

A: probably, just contact who's running it so, there quite, in the christen union the committee members are quite open just to talk to anyway  and I've spoken to them and am friends with some of them in that sense, it's quite easy if I need to talk to them if there organising an event I can just message them it's not like difficult or anything

Q: How long dose it take them to get back to you

A: umm, depends if there on there phone or not, but usually I don't know, they may see it in an hours time, but if it's not urgent, it's not a problem if they respond in a couple of hours but if it's more of an urgent thing then yes I would like them to respond to me as soon as possible but I haven't needed to do that

Q: so usually in a day then?

A: yes

Q: so do you usually miss event because you don't see the messages?

A: umm, no, it manly if there's conflict with what I'm doing that I don't go to events or what ever meetings rather than me not seeing it because I would know that's there rather than oh I can't make that because I've got lectures all day and I can't make that because it's too early or something

Q: so on WhatsApp and Instagram, what sort of posts do they put out?

A: umm, for the CU there is somewhat specifically to make sure that everything gets put on Instagram and WhatsApp so then everyone knows that it's happening, so on Thursday, there's a promise auction that's been  advertised on CU meeting on Monday and also has been on CU WhatsApp group chat and kind of announcements 

Q: so is it like an image or?

A: it's an image of the date and time and the place we're meeting and tells you what the event that we're running

Q: so what's your favourite app to use?

A: I manly use Instagram that's like the main one I use, I rarely use TikTok, Facebook if I want to look at trains and reddit if I wanna look at stranger things memes but other than that Instagram is the main one I use for every thing and message people

Q: so why do like Instagram, what puts it above the rest for you?

A: probably just the posts are funnier  when I scroll on Instagram reels for hours and also I also have friends on Instagram so I can just send reels to them, it's a lot more friends based so I can just send a video to someone like that (the interviewee clicks their fingers) so that why I quite like it and that everyone has Instagram as well so

Q: how many social media apps do you use overall, because you mentioned reddit and Facebook?

A: I manly use Instagram, I have WhatsApp, I have TikTok, I use Facebook for both just if I'm just really board and wanna look at trains or whatever, or to message my pearent because there on messenger, so it's easer if I just go on there, I use reddit for looking at gossip at Tesco, because I work at Tesco, and stranger things, because I like stranger things, I have twitter, but I don't like it at all, because I don't like how that's a bit... that's all the main social media that I have and mainly use

Q: how many societies where you interested in verses how many did you actually go to

A: I was intrigued by politics, because I like politics, but the timing is just, 6:30 on a Tuesday is when I finish at 6:00 is not great, and obviously before I went I made sure there was a christen union, I did kinda go round, but wasn't really into any others, I kinda spoke to some of them, but I wasn't interested in any of the sport societies because I'm not a sporty person

Q: so you said that you missed the events only because you had conflict with your schedule right?

A: there is no other reason it's just if I finish at 6 I don't feel like I wanna go to a society where I have to listen and I don't want to listen and I'd rather not go

Q: so genially you've been able to keep up with event and stuff?

A: yeah

Q: so what's the best way for you to interact with the society's event on social media and such, do you like them, reply to them?

A: if it's on WhatsApp I just open the message and read what it is, if it's on Instagram I like the post and obviously the story usually comes up so I just look at that and whatever is on there

Q: so when you've got an event, do you prefer to see the details first or like talking to someone about it or reserving a spot through an app 

A: so if there's an event coming up and it's just been posted I usually like to see what time it is, where it is and what it is, so I can plan like ok I can go to that or that's not a great time I can't go to that

Q: so reserving a spot through an app is something your interested in?

A: Like reserving a spot through an app?

Q: yes like RSCV basically, just to say yes I'm going

A: yeah, but I don't think with the society I'm in mainly, so the CU, it's kinda there's not real need for reserving a spot, because the space is as large as it can get people in and if necessary they'll book a different room to accommodate people in, so for that sense it's not necessary

Q: so if your sharing an event with a friend or something what's the easiest way to do that

A: like sharing an event?

Q: yeah like letting someone know that this society is having an event do you wanna come along

A: yeah, I think... with WhatsApp I can just forward it to them so if I have a friend that I think that it would be a fun idea for you to come to this it's just a social it's not too theologically heavy or whatever, so if I wanted to bring a non-christen friend with me I could just forward the message to them and they could respond if they want to or not

Q: would seeing a guest list help influencing you going to an event

A: so if there is an event and  they've got people... like running it or?

Q: in seeing who's going

A: uhm, yeah, but at the same time usually I just ask my friends if there going or just assume they do because they go every week anyway, so maybe for people what don't know names, but for me who has friends in there I don't think it's necessary to have a list of people who are going if you know your friends who are going, you just ask your friend if there going so you can be like yeah I'll go to that as well, or nah I don't know anyone so what's the point in me going

Q: are you a society committee member?

A: No
