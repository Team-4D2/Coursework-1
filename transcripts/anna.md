## Society Members

1. How many socs are you a part of?
6

2. How many different apps do you have for society news?
- Would you be interested in something to put all of these in one place?
Would be nice to have one space – convenient for sure. Currently I most of them are on WhatsApp except 2.

3. When you are missing information, how do you get in touch with your societies?
- How long does it take for them to get back to you?
Through specific chats (general chats in WhatsApp community, a specified Discord channel, or group chat on Messenger). Responses are quite quick.

4. Do you find you miss events due to messages getting lost?
No, I just may forget the date.

5. What type of posts do the societies make on social media?
Calendars, pictures/vids from socials.

6. What is your favourite social media app that you use for societies and why?
I like Discord, because I am used to it, but most people like the WhatsApp communities and I like that they have good settings to handle a society too.

7. How many social media apps do you use, and of these which do you use the most and why?
Instagram, my beloved. (less beloved with the new UI update, fuck that. – bugs too)

8. How many societies were you interested in, and how many have you actually gone to?
- Why did you miss their events?
Way too many, at least once to all. Frequent member in 2 or 3 of them.

9. What's your best way to interact with a society's event?
Attend…

10. Do you prefer seeing the **details first, chatting to someone** before deciding or being able to **reserve a spot through an app**?
Idk bro

11. If you were to share an event with friends, what would be the easiest way for you to do that?
Just telling them about it. “Have you seen this announcement/event that is planned?”, “Hey, this soc is doing that, wanna join?”

12. If you’re deciding whether to attend an event, does viewing a guest list help?
Not… Well a little. Yeah it can sometimes. But more often than not the guest list doesn’t bother me, but the fact that 2 of my society events are crossing over, so maybe having a calendar that shows all my socs’ events at once to see when is what would be nice.

 
## Society Committee Members

1. How do distribute news to your members?
- Why do you use this method
Announcement channels. Sometimes people have the chat on muted and have notifications only for the announcements.

2. How would you say members engage with your announcements?
React with a like/heart/emoji.

3. What is the biggest hurdle to engage with your society?
Not compatible timings with my life.

4. What forms of media do you distribute and why? EG, text , images, video, polls
?? Text/images for announcements, videos/images/text for posting about social that happened, polls for events to be voted for the future.

5. Have you set up a shared calendar? If not would you believe a shared synced calendar would be useful?
Yes. (IT Society)

6. Do you send out communication over more than one channel already?
Not usually.

7. Do you manage your society on multiple social media accounts, if so how difficult is it to do so.
It is not my role to take care of social media, so I don’t. I only posts announcements occasionally on our main means of communication.

8. When managing queries related to the society, how long do you typically take to reply.
Depends which of my two societies and whether I have the information to answer

9. When posting about events, what information do you typically include?
What, when, where? Bring something with? Encouragement to join.

10. What is your typical event turnout, and how do you think it might be improved?
Depends society to society. Sometimes it’s just the people and if they’re picking over two soc events and don’t have “loyalty”/priority with yours you have low turnout.
