Q: and how many different apps do you have for society news?

A: None

Q: so how do you get announcements for it and stuff?

A: Because it's my church, my pastor told me about it, so that how I found out about it, so we have like a WhatsApp group chat and that's how we communicate

Q: So just WhatsApp then?

A: yeah

Q: So you only use WhatsApp then?

A: yeah

Q: not Instagram at all

A: no, oh yeah they have Instagram as well they have like a page, but to speak to them it's manly on WhatsApp

Q: so do they post announcements on there Instagram?

A: yeah

Q: So is there any other apps, like Facebook and Snapchat?

A: No, it's just Instagram and WhatsApp

Q: or email at all?

A: No

Q: So would you be interested in something that puts all that Instagram and WhatsApp all in one place?

A: yeah, I think that's a good idea

Q: So when your missing information about society events, how do you get in touch with them, through WhatsApp?

A: yeah through WhatsApp, messaging, or WhatsApp each other

Q: and how long does it take them to get back to you about it?

A: it depends on how busy they are, it could take like a day or a few hours, it just depends  to be honest

Q: so roughly with in a day?

A: yeah I would say

Q: SO do you ever miss event because you don't see messages?

A: I tend to read my messages, so not really, yeah not really I don't do personally, but I know other people yeah, because not everyone opens there messages

Q: so what type of posts do your society put up on social media?

A: they post like there events, especially event that they might be hosting to like invite people

Q: so is it like images they put up or any text?

A: yeah, like posters, images, just different things

Q: so what's your favourite social media app overall?

A: Overall? defiantly Instagram and TikTok

Q: and why do you like those?

A: TikTok I don't know, it's just engaging I guess, both are quite engaging, I just like the content on both

Q: is it genuinely just doom scrolling?

A: yeah, it's not good, but yo, doom scrolling

Q: How many social media apps do you use overall?

A: overall? so it's Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, WhatsApp. I would say around four, yeah four

Q: So which one do you use the most, is that Instagram or TikTok

A: I think TikTok

Q: and that just for the scroll?

A: yeah

Q: So from the start of the year, how many societies where you interested in and how many did you go to?

A: So, I was also interested in the ACS, I wouldn't say I joined as per say, but  I've attended one event, but it's not like a society I'm apart of

Q: so how did you find out about that first event then?

A: it was through a friend, but I think he's with that society, so that's how I got to go

Q: so what's the best way for you to interact with the society's events, so like on WhatsApp do you tend to reply to the event or react to it and stuff like that?

A: Yeah, I would like reply if I'm coming or not

Q: So on Instagram do you like interact with it at all if you see anything

A: not really no

Q: Do you prefer to look at the details and then go to them

A: yeah

Q: So would you prefer, because you mentioned talking to the pastor and stuff before, what helps the most, is it talking to someone about it or seeing the details?

A: I think, probably talking to someone, because I feel like even though it's advertised, it may not really attract me, where as if a person is like I think you should go to this event, it'll be fun or interested I'm more likely to go

Q: so would you be intrusted in reserving a spot through an app?

A: Reserving a spot though an app?

Q: yeah through an app

A: yeah

Q: so if you wanted to share the event with a friend, how would you do that?

A: I think just speaking to them through word of mouth, or like messaging them, through maybe Snap or Instagram, or WhatsApp

Q: So do you just message them normally or do you screenshot them?

A: so I would take a screenshot of the poster or whatever and just send it to them or tell them about it

Q: and so does seeing a guest list influence whether you go to an event?

A: not really no, no it doesn't

Q: you not a society committee member are you?

A: no I am not
