The system diagram outlines a client-server architecture designed to manage a university society application. The structure is divided into two main areas: the client side, which includes the user interfaces for "Committee" members and "Society Members," and the server side, which handles all the processing, logic, and data storage. The server is organized into four main sections that handle specific tasks: authentication, society management, event management, and post management.

The Account Manager, which contains the "Sign Up" and "Login" forms. When a user enters their details, the data is sent to an "Authentication Manager" to check if the information is correct. There is also a "Join Society" feature here, allowing users to become part of a specific group once they are logged in.

The society management. This part of the system handles the information for the society. It includes features for viewing the member list, contacting other members, and contacting the committee. It also allows administrative users to update the society's description and send push notifications to users. A "Society Manager" controls this section, handling requests such as getting the list of members or finding societies for a user to subscribe to.

The event management section. This module is responsible for scheduling. Users can "Create Events" or "Modify Events." Once an event is created or changed, the details are sent to a "Generate Calendar" component, which likely organizes the dates for the user to view. This entire process is overseen by the "Event Manager." Connected to this is the post management section at the bottom in red. This allows users to create and modify posts on a feed. It also includes a "Like post" feature, which sends updated like counts back to the modify component. Arrows connecting the event and post sections suggest that posts can be linked directly to specific events.

Finally, all the data from these different sections is stored in a central database on the far right. The system does not connect every single component directly to the database. Instead, it uses a "Database Connector." This acts as a central hub. The Account, Society, Event, and Post Managers all send their data to this connector, which then handles the actual reading and writing to the "Database."
